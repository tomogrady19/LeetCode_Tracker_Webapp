## LeetCode Tracker

This project is a full-stack web application I built to practice backend development, databases, and CI/CD pipelines.  
It tracks and displays live LeetCode statistics for a given user, and tracks which users have been searched for the most.
(I don't know many users, so it's fun to search the names of celebrities or fictional characters as people sometimes use them as sudonyms)

The app includes:
- FastAPI backend with RESTful endpoints  
- PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage (I started off with SQLite but decided to upgrade)
- JavaScript front-end for a simple, interactive UI 
- CI/CD automation to handle automatic deployment everytime I commit ne changes
- Hosted live at: (https://leetcode-tracker-d1lz.onrender.com)

This project helped me improve my understanding of backend APIs, database integration, and deploying a complete application.
